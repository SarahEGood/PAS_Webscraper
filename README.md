# PAS Webscraper
This is a webscraper for downloading images from the [Portable Antiquities Scheme](https://finds.org.uk/database).

## How to use
Once you've downloaded the notebook, you will need to download .csv files from the website.

- Enter a search query at [Portable Antiquities Scheme](https://finds.org.uk/database) for the artefacts you are interested in.
- If your query is less than 12,000 items, you can download the .csv file.
- If your query is any larger, you will need split your query and download multiple .csv files. Fortunately, you can run the webscraping function multiple times.
